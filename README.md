# This was done as a university assignment for a module called "applications: architectures and frameworks"
The specification required us to use two javascript frameworks to build an API and a frontend for a web application, demonstrating our understanding of document databases and MVC approaches.

I was allowed the exception of using Go for the API! This was my first time writing go code and was a lot of fun.

Also included in the repository is a frontend to consume the API, built in react
